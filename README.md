## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "API key is invalid" or "401 Unauthorized"
```bash
# Solution 1: ACTIVATE PAYMENTS (Most Common Issue)
# - Visit https://console.mistral.ai/
# - Go to Organization > Billing
# - Add payment information and activate payments
# - Choose "Experiment" (free trial) or "Scale" (pay-as-you-go)
# - Wait 5-10 minutes after activation

# Solution 2: Double-check your API key
# - Visit https://console.mistral.ai/
# - Copy the key exactly as shown
# - Avoid extra spaces or characters

# Solution 3: Test API key manually
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     "https://api.mistral.ai/v1/models"
```

Important: Mistral requires activated payments even for free trial usage. The most common cause of 401 errors is not having activated billing.

#### "tmux command not found" after installation
```bash
# Solution: Reload your shell
source ~/.bashrc
# or
source ~/.zshrc
# or simply start a new terminal session
```

#### "Permission denied" errors
Ensure you have proper permissions. The installer may need sudo for package installation and your home directory should be writable for config files.

#### macOS: "Homebrew not found"
```bash
# Solution: Install Homebrew first
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Then run the TmuxAI installer again
```
